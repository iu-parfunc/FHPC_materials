Early Registration Deadline: August 22, 2013
Registration: https://regmaster3.com/2013conf/ICFP13/register.php

Co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming
                               (ICFP 2013)

=====================================================================

The FHPC workshop aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses
of functional (or more generally, declarative or high-level)
programming technology in application domains where large-scale
computations arise naturally and high performance is essential.
Modern highly parallel systems, such as manycore multi-processor
systems, large-scale compute clusters, and graphics accelerators
(GPGPUs) as well as reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs), are complex to
program, and declarative languages present a nice sweet spot between
expressiveness and efficiency when programming such systems, to
address their inherent complexity and to reconcile execution
performance with programming productivity.
The aim of the meeting is to enable sharing of results, experiences,
and novel ideas about how high-level, declarative specifications of
computationally challenging problems can serve as highly transparent,
maintainable, and portable code that approaches (or even exceeds) the
performance of machine-oriented imperative implementations.

Papers and Invited Talks:
=========================
The accepted papers cover different topics related to FHPC:
declarative parallel programming models, optimising compilation of
declarative languages, libraries and bespoke runtime management which
take advantage of declarative constructs for better performance and
productivity.
FHPC'13 features two invited talks and one panel discussion.
In the morning session, Matthew Fluet from Rochester Institute of
Technology will provide an overview of the Manticore project.
In the late afternoon session, Manuel Chakravarty from the University
of New South Wales will present his work in data-parallel computing,
Data-Parallel Haskell and Accelerate. The topic of data-parallelism
and GPU computing will be further deepened in a panel discussion.
