Dear programme committee,

The FHPC deadline has now passed, and we have closed the submission
page.  We received a total of 14 valid submissions (plus a few "test"
submissions).

The next step from here is your main role, refereeing the papers.
We will assign 3 referees to each paper before Sunday, taking into
consideration your preferences and conflicts.

At this point, we would like to ask you to make bids for the papers
you would like to referee, and - more important - to mark potential
conflicts of interest (ACM defines criteria for such conflicts as (1)
having co-authored papers with one of the authors recently, (2) having
the same affiliation as one of the authors, or (3) being relative to
one of the authors)

Please place your bids *before Saturday*, Proceeding as follows:

o log in to Easychair
  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhpc2013
  You should see the FHPC main page.
o in the menu on top, select "paper bidding"
o indicate your preferences to referee or not referee particular
  submissions, and your conflicts of interest. You won't be able to
  see submissions with conflict of interest later. Some obvious
  conflicts have already been marked by us.
o Save your input by clicking "save" to leave the page.

We will get back to you with paper assignments on Monday (latest).

Best wishes,
Jost and Umut (Programme co-chairs)

PS: This is also a good moment to think about potential invited
talks. Your suggestions for invited speakers are most welcome!
