	<div><p>The <a href="http://hiperfit.dk/fhpc13.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FHPC workshop</a>
 aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses of functional (or 
more generally, declarative or high-level) programming technology in 
application domains where large-scale computations arise naturally and 
high performance is essential. Such computations would typically -- but 
not necessarily -- involve execution on highly parallel systems ranging 
from multi-core multi-processor systems to graphics accelerators 
(GPGPUs), reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs), large-scale compute clusters 
or any combination thereof. It is becoming apparent that radically new 
and well founded methodologies for programming such systems are required
 to address their inherent complexity and to reconcile execution 
performance with programming productivity.</p><p>The aim of the meeting 
is to enable sharing of results, experiences, and novel ideas about how 
high-level, declarative specifications of computationally challenging 
problems can serve as highly transparent, maintainable, and portable 
code that approaches (or even exceeds) the performance of 
machine-oriented imperative implementations.</p><p>Each FHPC workshop 
proposes a particular theme for applications where high-performance 
computing and/or functional programming technology can be applied. For 
FHPC 2013, the theme is "Large-Scale Simulation", traditionally one of 
the main driving forces behind supercomputing.<br>A large fraction of 
compute cycles in supercomputers worldwide is spent on simulation tasks,
 for various engineering tasks, drug design and other medical 
simulations, and in different natural science domains. Declarative 
languages have potential to radically change development practice and 
workflow for simulation software in these areas. Hence, we particularly 
encourage submission of application-oriented contributions in the area 
of simulation.&nbsp; <br>As a general rule, while proposing the theme, the 
workshop welcomes submissions from all relevant application domains as 
well as those describing general work on the theory and practice of 
declarative high-performance computing.</p><p><strong>Proceedings:</strong><br>Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the ACM Digital Library.</p><ul><li>Submission Deadline: 19 June 2013 (anywhere on earth) -- extended</li><li>Author Notification: 11 July 2013</li><li>Final Papers Due&nbsp;&nbsp; : 25 July 2013<br></li></ul><p>Contributions should be submitted via Easychair: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhpc2013" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhpc2013</a>.<br>Submitted
 papers must be in portable document format (PDF), formatted according

 FHPC workshops adhere to the ACM SIGPLAN policies regarding programme 
committee contributions and republication. Any paper submitted must 
adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy. PC member submissions are&nbsp;
 welcome, but will be reviewed to a higher standard.<br><a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review</a><br><a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication</a></p><p><strong>Travel Support:</strong><br>Student
 attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to 
help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as for 
child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for 
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
 travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details 
on the PAC programme, see its web page (<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm</a>).</p><p><strong>Programme Committee:</strong><br>Umut Acar (co-chair), Carnegie Mellon U., PA, USA<br>Arvind, MIT, MA, USA<br>Jost Berthold (co-chair), U. of Copenhagen, Denmark<br>Guy Blelloch, Carnegie Mellon U., PA, USA<br>Hassan Chafi, Oracle Labs, CA, USA<br>Dan Spoonhower, Google, CA, USA<br>Sergei Gorlatch, U.
