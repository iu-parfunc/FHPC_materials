                    The 3rd ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
                 Functional High-Performance Computing

                          Gothenburg, Sweden
                           September 4, 2014

Co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming
                             (ICFP 2014)

Submission Deadline: Thursday, 15 May, 2014 (anywhere on earth)
=====================================================================

The FHPC workshop aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses
of functional (or more generally, declarative or high-level)
programming technology in application domains where high performance
is essential.  The aim of the meeting is to enable sharing of results,
experiences, and novel ideas about how high-level, declarative
specifications of computationally challenging problems can serve as
maintainable and portable code that approaches (or even exceeds) the
performance of machine-oriented imperative implementations.

All aspects of performance critical programming and parallel
programming are in-scope for the workshop, irrespective of hardware
target.  This includes both traditional large-scale scientific
computing (HPC), as well as work targeting single node systems with
SMPs, GPUs, FPGAs, or embedded processors.  It is becoming apparent
that radically new and well founded methodologies for programming such
systems are required to address their inherent complexity and to
reconcile execution performance with programming productivity.

Every year, the FHPC workshop has an application area as a theme.
Papers touching on this topic are especially encouraged, though all
in-scope papers are welcomed.  For FHPC 2014, the theme is
"Heterogeneous computing".  In the systems and parallelism
communities, there has been a lot of work on programming systems with
CPUs and GPUs (or other mixed parallel architectures), but in the
programming languages community this idea has not received as much
attention.  At their best, high-level languages can have the degrees
of flexibility necessary to abstract over platform differences.

Travel Support:
===============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such
as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC programme, see its web page (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).
