<h2>Workshop Topic</h2>

<p>The FHPC workshop aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses
of functional (or more generally, declarative or high-level)
programming technology in application domains where high performance
is essential.  The aim of the meeting is to enable sharing of results,
experiences, and novel ideas about how high-level, declarative
specifications of computationally challenging problems can serve as
maintainable and portable code that approaches (or even exceeds) the
performance of machine-oriented imperative implementations.
<br>
All aspects of performance critical programming and parallel
programming are in-scope for the workshop, irrespective of hardware
target.  This includes both traditional large-scale scientific
computing (HPC), as well as work targeting single node systems with
SMPs, GPUs, FPGAs, or embedded processors.
</p>
<p>Every year, the FHPC workshop has an <b>application area as a theme</b>.
Papers touching on this topic are especially encouraged, though all
in-scope papers are welcomed.  For FHPC 2014, the theme is
"<b>Heterogeneous computing</b>".

</p>
<h2>Location, registration, travel<br>
</h2>
<p>FHPC'14 will be held at the <a href="http://www.svenskamassan.se/en/">Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre</a> in central Gothenburg.<br>
The workshop is co-located with the ICFP 2014 conference. Please see the <a href="http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2014/local.html">ICFP local information pages</a> for travel information and tipps.</p>
<p>Participants should register for the workshop using the <a href="http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2014">ICFP central conference registration</a>, by a day pass for the workshop day, and indicating that they will attend FHPC.<br>
</p>
<p>Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such
as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC programme, see <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm">its web page</a>.</p>

<h2>Accepted Papers, Invited Talk, Workshop Programme<br>
</h2>
<p>The programme committee has accepted 10 submissions. Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the ACM Digital Library. In addition to the accepted papers, FHPC 2014 will feature an invited talk by <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/">Keshav Pingali</a> (U.Texas at Austin).<br>
The workshop programme is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fhpcworkshops/fhpc-2014/programme">detailed on a separate page</a>.<br>
